# Flutter Pay

## Apple and Google Pay Flutter Plugin

This is a plugin in very early development right now with the hopes to support native payment systems such as Apple and Google Pay.

The example app is very simple right now and simply has one button which when clicked will open the setup for the Google Pay picker.

### In development

* Setting types of payment methods allowed
* grabbing a payment token from Google Pay
